# Two-Key-Transposition-Encryption
My own Encryption Technique for Encrypting and Decrypting text using two public key.
calculated as x = addition of each character of text mod 26 and
y = multiplication of each character of text mod 26
----->Advantage:
        text was Encrypting two time for better security
----->Disadvantage
since total number of character are 26 and our matrix was 5x5 we eliminated z from it
